\section{TODO/Plan}

\begin{myenum}
\item classical cipher.
  review and summarize
  least amount of elementary number theory without
  proofs. mainly some congruence arithmetic.
  use gcd to detect inverse mod 25. also use $\phi(n)$ to compute
  size of key space for affine.
  substitution cipher and permutation cipher will be good prep for
  group theory.
  also hill cipher has matrices mod 26 which is also good prep for group
  theory.
\item elementary number theory at the level of math225 with complete proofs
  and extra info for RSA
\item RSA
\item redo elementary theory by doing groups, rings, fields, etc.
\item DLG and abelian group based ciphers forcusing on $U(\Z/p)$, etc.
  excpet ECC should be a separate chapter.
\item ECC
\item Cryptohash
\item PRNG
\item DES, 3DES, AES
\item bitcoin and blockchain
\end{myenum}


\section{Instructions}

If you see a TODO, it means you have to fill in the details.
This includes TODO in definitions,
examples,
propositions/lemmas/theorems/corollaries,
and some exercises.
Examples are included so that you understand the expected level of rigor.
Make sure you should study the examples carefully.
